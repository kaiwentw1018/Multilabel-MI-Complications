# Multi-label Neural Model for Prediction of Myocardial Infarction Complications with Resampling and Explainability
This repository is the official implementation of [Multi-label Neural Model for Prediction of Myocardial Infarction Complications with Resampling and Explainability]. 

## Data Processing
To process the dataset as it is done in the paper (with robust scaling and SMOTE), run this [notebook](https://github.com/lujainibrahim/ecg-view-machine-learning/blob/master/data%20processing/data_processing.ipynb).

## Training


## Evaluation


## Results
Our models achieve the following performances:
